"Commit and push the changes"
"Check the git status of my project"

# Environment management
"List all my current development environments"
"Get details about my Python sandbox"
"Clean up old testing environments"
```

### Direct API Interface

For programmatic access, the integration supports structured API calls:

```python
# Create a new development environment
{
    "method": "create_sandbox",
    "params": {
        "language": "python",
        "name": "ml-project",
        "git_repo": "https://github.com/user/ml-project.git",
        "persistent": true,
        "environment_vars": {
            "PYTHONPATH": "/workspace",
            "ENV": "development"
        }
    }
}

# Execute code safely
{
    "method": "execute_code",
    "params": {
        "sandbox_id": "sandbox-abc123",
        "code": "import pandas as pd\nprint(pd.__version__)",
        "language": "python"
    }
}

# Manage files
{
    "method": "file_operation",
    "params": {
        "sandbox_id": "sandbox-abc123",
        "operation": "write",
        "file_path": "/app/config.py",
