graph LR
    A[LangSwarm Agent] --> B[MCP Tool Local]
    B --> C[Daytona Cloud API]
    C --> D[Managed Sandboxes]
    D --> E[Auto-scaling Infrastructure]
    
    style B fill:#e1f5fe
    style C fill:#f3e5f5
    style D fill:#e8f5e8
```

**Flow**:
1. LangSwarm agent receives user request
2. Local MCP tool processes request
3. API call to Daytona cloud service
4. Sandbox created on managed infrastructure
5. Results returned to agent

**Deployment**:
```yaml
tools:
  - id: daytona_env
    type: daytona_environment
    local_mode: true  # MCP tool runs locally
    api_key: "${DAYTONA_API_KEY}"
```

### Self-Hosted Architecture

```mermaid

    A[LangSwarm Agent] --> B[HTTP MCP Server]
    B --> C[Daytona CLI]
    C --> D[Self-Hosted Daytona]
    D --> E[Local Docker Containers]
    
    style B fill:#fff3e0
    style C fill:#f1f8e9
    style D fill:#fce4ec
```

**Flow**:
1. LangSwarm agent makes HTTP request
2. MCP server receives and processes request
3. Server executes Daytona CLI commands
4. Self-hosted Daytona creates containers
5. Results returned via HTTP response

**Deployment**:
```yaml
tools:
  - id: daytona_self_hosted
    type: remote_mcp
    url: "http://daytona-mcp.internal:8001"
    local_mode: false  # HTTP server mode
```

## Configuration Examples

### Cloud-Based Configuration

```yaml
# langswarm.yaml
tools:
  - id: daytona_cloud
    type: daytona_environment
    description: "Managed Daytona environments"
    local_mode: true
    pattern: "intent"
    main_workflow: "use_daytona_environment_tool"
    permission: authenticated
    config:
      api_key: "${DAYTONA_API_KEY}"
      default_language: "python"
      default_persistent: false

workflows:
  development:
    steps:
      - tool: daytona_cloud
        action: "Create Python environment for ${project_name}"
      - tool: daytona_cloud
        action: "Clone repository ${repo_url}"
      - tool: daytona_cloud
        action: "Run tests and deployment checks"
```

### Self-Hosted Configuration

```yaml
# langswarm.yaml
tools:
  - id: daytona_onprem
    type: remote_mcp
    url: "http://daytona-mcp.internal:8001"
    description: "On-premises Daytona environments"
    permission: authenticated
    timeout: 60
    retry_count: 3
    auth:
      type: api_key
      header: "X-API-Key"

services:
  daytona-server:
    image: daytonaio/daytona:latest
    volumes:
      - daytona_data:/data
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    networks: [internal]
    
  daytona-mcp:
    build: ./daytona_self_hosted
    depends_on: [daytona-server]
    environment:
      - DAYTONA_SERVER_URL=http://daytona-server:8080
    networks: [internal]
```

## Migration Strategies

### Cloud to Self-Hosted Migration

**Phase 1**: Parallel Deployment
```yaml
tools:
  # Existing cloud integration
  - id: daytona_cloud
    type: daytona_environment
    
  # New self-hosted integration (testing)
  - id: daytona_test
    type: remote_mcp
    url: "http://test-daytona.internal:8001"
```

**Phase 2**: Gradual Migration
```yaml
workflows:
  development:
    steps:
      - condition: "${environment} == 'production'"
        tool: daytona_onprem
      - condition: "${environment} == 'development'"
        tool: daytona_cloud
```

**Phase 3**: Complete Migration
```yaml
tools:
  - id: daytona_primary
    type: remote_mcp
    url: "http://daytona-mcp.internal:8001"
```

### Self-Hosted to Cloud Migration

**Benefits of Migration**:
- Reduced operational overhead
- Automatic scaling and updates
- Global availability
- Pay-per-use cost model

**Migration Steps**:
1. **Setup cloud integration** alongside self-hosted
2. **Migrate non-sensitive workloads** to cloud
3. **Evaluate cost and performance** differences
4. **Gradually migrate remaining workloads**
5. **Decommission self-hosted infrastructure**

---

## Decision Framework

### Choose Cloud-Based When:

‚úÖ **Speed is critical** - need environments in seconds
‚úÖ **Team is distributed** - global access required
‚úÖ **No compliance restrictions** - can use external services
‚úÖ **Limited ops resources** - want managed infrastructure
‚úÖ **Variable usage patterns** - benefit from pay-per-use
‚úÖ **Rapid scaling needed** - auto-scaling requirements

### Choose Self-Hosted When:

‚úÖ **Data must stay internal** - compliance or security requirements
‚úÖ **Air-gapped deployment** - no external network access
‚úÖ **Custom infrastructure** - specific hardware or network needs
‚úÖ **Full control required** - need complete customization
‚úÖ **Predictable usage** - can optimize infrastructure costs
‚úÖ **Integration requirements** - need deep integration with internal systems

### Hybrid Approach When:

‚úÖ **Mixed requirements** - different projects have different needs
‚úÖ **Migration in progress** - transitioning between deployment models
‚úÖ **Development vs Production** - different requirements per environment
‚úÖ **Cost optimization** - balance between convenience and control

| Metric | Typical Value | Description |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| **Environment Creation** | 50-90ms | Sub-second sandbox creation |
| **Code Execution** | Near-native | Minimal performance overhead |
| **Network Latency** | 50-200ms | Depends on geographic location |
| **Concurrent Environments** | 100+ | Limited by account quotas |
| **Storage Performance** | High | SSD-backed managed storage |

### Self-Hosted Performance

| Metric | Typical Value | Description |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| **Environment Creation** | 2-5 seconds | Depends on base image and resources |
| **Code Execution** | Native | Direct hardware access |
| **Network Latency** | <10ms | Local network performance |
| **Concurrent Environments** | Hardware-limited | Based on allocated resources |
| **Storage Performance** | Variable | Depends on local storage setup |

## Cost Analysis

### Cloud-Based Costs

**Pricing Model**: Pay-per-use
- **Environment hours**: $0.10-$0.50 per hour per environment
- **Storage**: $0.10 per GB per month
- **Data transfer**: $0.05 per GB
- **API calls**: Typically included

**Example Monthly Costs**:
- Small team (5 developers): $200-$500
- Medium team (20 developers): $800-$2000
- Large team (100 developers): $4000-$10000

### Self-Hosted Costs

**Infrastructure Costs**:
- **Compute**: $500-$5000+ per month (depends on scale)
- **Storage**: $50-$500 per month
- **Network**: Existing infrastructure
- **Maintenance**: 0.5-2 FTE depending on scale

**Example Monthly Costs**:
- Small deployment: $1000-$2000 (infrastructure + partial FTE)
- Medium deployment: $3000-$8000
- Large deployment: $10000-$25000+

**Break-even Analysis**:
- Self-hosted typically becomes cost-effective at 50+ heavy users
- Cloud remains cost-effective for variable or light usage
- Factor in operational overhead and expertise requirements
