## Navigation Modes

### 1. Manual Mode
Agent has full control over step selection from available options.

```yaml
navigation:
  mode: "manual"
  steps:
    - id: "technical_support"
      name: "Technical Support"
      description: "Route to technical support team"
      type: "agent"
      agent_id: "technical_agent"
    - id: "billing_support"
      name: "Billing Support"
      description: "Route to billing team"
      type: "agent"
      agent_id: "billing_agent"
```

### 2. Conditional Mode
Automatic routing based on predefined rules and conditions.

```yaml
navigation:
  mode: "conditional"
  rules:
    - conditions:
        - field: "output.category"
          operator: "eq"
          value: "technical"
      target_step: "technical_support"
      priority: 10
```

### 3. Hybrid Mode
Combines conditional rules with agent decision-making.

```yaml
navigation:
  mode: "hybrid"
  rules:
    - conditions:
        - field: "output.priority"
          operator: "eq"
          value: "critical"
      target_step: "escalate"
      priority: 10
  steps:
    - id: "technical_support"
      name: "Technical Support"
      description: "Technical issue resolution"
      conditions:
        - field: "output.category"
          operator: "eq"
          value: "technical"
```

## Configuration Schema

### NavigationStep

```yaml
steps:
  - id: "step_id"                    # Unique identifier
    name: "Human-readable name"      # Display name
    description: "Detailed description"  # What this step does
    type: "agent"                    # Step type (agent, webhook, etc.)
    agent_id: "agent_identifier"     # Agent to execute this step
    conditions:                      # Availability conditions
      - field: "output.category"
        operator: "eq"
        value: "technical"
    weight: 1.0                      # Selection weight (for weighted mode)
    metadata:                        # Additional step metadata
      estimated_time: "2 hours"
      skill_level: "intermediate"
```

```yaml
rules:
  - conditions:                      # List of conditions (AND logic)
      - field: "output.priority"
        operator: "eq"
        value: "critical"
    target_step: "escalate"          # Target step when rule matches
    priority: 10                     # Rule priority (higher = first)
    description: "Auto-escalate critical issues"
```

## Analytics and Tracking

### Navigation Decision Tracking

Every navigation decision is automatically tracked with:

- **Decision ID**: Unique identifier
- **Workflow & Step Context**: Where the decision was made
- **Agent Information**: Which agent made the decision
- **Available Options**: All steps that were available
- **Chosen Step**: The selected step
- **Reasoning**: Agent's explanation for the choice
- **Confidence Score**: How confident the agent was
- **Performance Metrics**: Execution time, etc.

### Analytics Dashboard

```python
from langswarm.features.intelligent_navigation import NavigationTracker

tracker = NavigationTracker()

# Get comprehensive analytics
analytics = tracker.get_analytics(workflow_id="support_routing")

print(f"Total Decisions: {analytics.total_decisions}")
print(f"Average Confidence: {analytics.avg_confidence:.2f}")
print(f"Most Common Paths: {analytics.most_common_paths}")
print(f"Optimization Suggestions: {analytics.optimization_suggestions}")
```

### Performance Insights

The system provides actionable insights:

- **Low Confidence Decisions**: Identify steps that need better descriptions
- **Common Routing Patterns**: Optimize frequently used paths
- **Decision Time Analysis**: Find bottlenecks in navigation
- **Loop Detection**: Prevent infinite navigation cycles
- **A/B Testing Results**: Compare different routing strategies

## Usage Examples

### Basic Python Integration

```python
from langswarm.features.intelligent_navigation import WorkflowNavigator, NavigationConfig

# Create navigator
navigator = WorkflowNavigator()

# Configure navigation
config = NavigationConfig(
    mode="hybrid",
    steps=[
        # ... step definitions
    ],
    rules=[
        # ... conditional rules
    ]
)

# Execute navigation
result = navigator.navigate(config, context)
print(f"Chosen step: {result.chosen_step}")
print(f"Reasoning: {result.reasoning}")
```

### Integration with LangSwarm Workflows

```python
from langswarm.core.config import LangSwarmConfigLoader

# Load workflow with navigation
config = LangSwarmConfigLoader()
workflow = config.load_workflow("support_routing.yaml")

# Navigation happens automatically during execution
result = workflow.execute(user_input="Help with billing issue")
```

## Advanced Features

### Loop Prevention

The system automatically detects and prevents infinite navigation loops:

```python
# Automatic loop detection
if len(context.step_history) > 10:
    recent_steps = [s['step_id'] for s in context.step_history[-5:]]
    if len(set(recent_steps)) < 3:
        raise NavigationLoopError(recent_steps)
```

### Weighted Step Selection

In weighted mode, steps are selected based on probability:

```yaml
steps:
  - id: "high_priority"
    weight: 3.0  # 3x more likely to be selected
  - id: "normal_priority"
    weight: 1.0
  - id: "low_priority"
    weight: 0.5  # 50% as likely to be selected
```

### Context-Aware Prompting

Navigation prompts are dynamically generated with rich context:

```python
prompt_template = """
You are navigating workflow: {workflow_id}
Current step: {current_step}
Previous steps: {step_history}
Available options: {available_steps}
Context data: {context}

Select the best next step and explain your reasoning.
"""
```

## Best Practices

### 1. **Clear Step Descriptions**
```yaml
description: "Route to technical support team for bugs, technical issues, and software problems"
```

### 2. **Meaningful Conditions**
```yaml
conditions:
  - field: "output.category"
    operator: "eq"
    value: "technical"
    description: "Ticket is categorized as technical issue"
```

### 3. **Appropriate Weights**
```yaml
weight: 2.0  # Higher weight for critical paths
```

### 4. **Fallback Steps**
```yaml
fallback_step: "general_support"  # Always have a fallback
```

### 5. **Performance Monitoring**
```python
# Regular analytics review
analytics = tracker.get_analytics()
if analytics.avg_confidence < 0.6:
    # Improve step descriptions
    pass
```

## Migration Guide

### From Static Workflows

**Before:**
```yaml
steps:
  - id: "analyze"
    agent: "analyzer"
    output:
      to: "technical_support"  # Fixed routing
```

**After:**
```yaml
steps:
  - id: "analyze"
    agent: "analyzer"
    output:
      to: "routing_decision"
  
  - id: "routing_decision"
    type: "navigation"
    navigation:
      mode: "hybrid"
      steps:
        - id: "technical_support"
          # ... configuration
        - id: "billing_support"
          # ... configuration
```

### Gradual Migration

1. **Start with conditional mode** for deterministic routing
2. **Add manual mode** for complex decisions
3. **Upgrade to hybrid mode** for optimal flexibility
4. **Enable analytics** for continuous improvement

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No Available Steps Error**
```python
# Ensure at least one step is always available
fallback_step: "general_support"
```

**Low Confidence Decisions**
```yaml
# Improve step descriptions
description: "Detailed explanation of what this step does and when to use it"
```

**Performance Issues**
```yaml
# Optimize timeouts
timeout_seconds: 15  # Reduce if needed
max_attempts: 2      # Limit retry attempts
```

### Debug Mode

```python
navigator = WorkflowNavigator(debug=True)
# Enables detailed logging and decision tracing
```
