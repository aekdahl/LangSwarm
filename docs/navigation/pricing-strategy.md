## Decision Cost Analysis

### Token Usage Estimation

**Average Decision Costs:**
- Simple navigation (3 options): ~150 tokens
- Complex navigation (8 options): ~400 tokens
- Hybrid with rich context: ~600 tokens

**Monthly Cost Examples (with GPT-4):**
- 1,000 simple decisions: ~$0.90 in LLM costs
- 10,000 complex decisions: ~$24.00 in LLM costs
- 100,000 hybrid decisions: ~$360.00 in LLM costs

*Note: These are LLM costs only. LangSwarm navigation fees are separate.*

### Cost Optimization Tips

1. **Use Conditional Mode** for deterministic routing to reduce LLM calls
2. **Optimize Prompts** to reduce token usage
3. **Cache Common Decisions** to avoid repeated processing
4. **Implement Fallbacks** to prevent retry loops
