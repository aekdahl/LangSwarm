# üèóÔ∏è Your First LangSwarm Project

**Build a complete multi-agent AI system step-by-step.**

In this tutorial, you'll build a **Document Analysis System** that can read files, extract insights, and generate summaries using multiple AI agents working together.

## üéØ **What You'll Build**

A document analysis system with:
- üìÑ **Document Reader Agent** - Reads and parses files
- üîç **Analysis Agent** - Extracts key insights and data
- üìù **Summary Agent** - Creates comprehensive summaries
- üîÑ **Workflow Orchestration** - Coordinates all agents

## üöÄ **Step 1: Project Setup**

### **Create Project Directory**
```bash
mkdir my-langswarm-project
cd my-langswarm-project
```

### **Install LangSwarm**
```bash
pip install langswarm
```

### **Set API Key**
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
```

## üìù **Step 2: Create Configuration**

Create `langswarm.yaml`:
```yaml
version: "2.0"
name: "Document Analysis System"
description: "Multi-agent document analysis and summarization"

# Define our three agents
agents:
  - id: "document_reader"
    name: "Document Reader"
    provider: "openai"
    model: "gpt-4o"
    system_prompt: |
      You are a document reader specialist. Your job is to:
      1. Read and parse document content
      2. Identify document structure and format
      3. Extract raw text content cleanly
      4. Preserve important formatting and structure

  - id: "analyzer"
    name: "Content Analyzer" 
    provider: "openai"
    model: "gpt-4o"
    system_prompt: |
      You are a content analysis expert. Your job is to:
      1. Analyze document content for key themes and topics
      2. Extract important facts, figures, and data points
      3. Identify main arguments and conclusions
      4. Note any actionable items or recommendations

  - id: "summarizer"
    name: "Summary Generator"
    provider: "openai"
    model: "gpt-4o"
    system_prompt: |
      You are a summary specialist. Your job is to:
      1. Create clear, concise summaries
      2. Highlight the most important points
      3. Structure information logically
      4. Make content accessible to any audience

# Define tools for file operations
tools:
  filesystem:
    type: "mcp"
    local_mode: true
    description: "Read and write files"

# Define the analysis workflow
workflows:
  - id: "document_analysis"
    name: "Document Analysis Pipeline"
    description: "Complete document analysis from reading to summary"
    steps:
      - id: "read_step"
        agent: "document_reader"
        tools: ["filesystem"]
        description: "Read and parse the document"
        
      - id: "analyze_step"
        agent: "analyzer"
        input: "${read_step.output}"
        description: "Analyze content for insights"
        
      - id: "summarize_step"
        agent: "summarizer"
        input: "${analyze_step.output}"
        description: "Generate final summary"
        output: 
          to: "user"

# Memory configuration for persistent conversations
memory:
  backend: "sqlite"
  settings:
    persist_directory: "./data"

# Observability for debugging
observability:
  logging:
    level: "INFO"
  tracing:
    enabled: true
```

## ü§ñ **Step 3: Create the Main Script**

Create `analyze_document.py`:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Document Analysis System
A complete LangSwarm V2 example showing multi-agent workflows.
"""

import asyncio
import sys
from pathlib import Path
from langswarm.core.config import load_config
from langswarm.core.workflows import get_workflow_engine
from langswarm.core.agents import AgentBuilder

async def main():
    """Main function to run document analysis."""
    
    # Check if document path provided
    if len(sys.argv) < 2:
        print("Usage: python analyze_document.py <path_to_document>")
        print("Example: python analyze_document.py ./sample_document.txt")
        return
    
    document_path = sys.argv[1]
    
    # Verify document exists
    if not Path(document_path).exists():
        print(f"‚ùå Document not found: {document_path}")
        return
    
    print(f"üöÄ Starting document analysis for: {document_path}")
    print("=" * 60)
    
    try:
        # Load configuration
        print("üìã Loading configuration...")
        config = load_config("langswarm.yaml")
        print(f"‚úÖ Loaded {len(config.agents)} agents and {len(config.workflows)} workflows")
        
        # Get workflow engine
        print("üîß Initializing workflow engine...")
        engine = get_workflow_engine()
        
        # Execute the document analysis workflow
        print("üîÑ Running document analysis workflow...")
        result = await engine.execute_workflow(
            workflow_id="document_analysis",
            input_data={
                "document_path": document_path,
                "user_request": f"Please analyze the document at {document_path}"
            }
        )
        
        # Display results
        print("\n" + "=" * 60)
        print("üìä ANALYSIS RESULTS")
        print("=" * 60)
        print(result.output)
        print("\n" + "=" * 60)
        print(f"‚úÖ Analysis completed successfully!")
        print(f"üìà Workflow executed in {result.execution_time:.2f} seconds")
        
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"‚ùå Error during analysis: {e}")
        import traceback
        traceback.print_exc()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## üìÑ **Step 4: Create Sample Document**

Create `sample_document.txt`:
```text
