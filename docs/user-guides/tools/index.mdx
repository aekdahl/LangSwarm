# 🛠️ Tools (MCP)

LangSwarm uses the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** as its universal standard for connecting agents to external data and systems.

Instead of writing custom python functions for every tool, you can connect your agents to any **MCP Server**—whether it's running locally on your machine or hosted remotely.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Connect an agent to the `filesystem` and `sqlite` tools in seconds using `uvx`.

```python
from langswarm.core.agents import AgentBuilder

agent = await (AgentBuilder("researcher")
    .openai()
    .model("gpt-4o")
    
    # 1. Connect to Local Filesystem
    .add_mcp_server(
        name="fs",
        command="uvx", 
        args=["mcp-server-filesystem", "/Users/alex/projects"]
    )
    
    # 2. Connect to Remote API (SSE)
    .add_mcp_server(
        name="api",
        url="https://api.weather.com/mcp"
    )
    .build())

# Agent can now read files and check weather!
result = await agent.chat("Read analysis.py and check the weather in NYC")
```

## 📚 Guides

| Guide | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[Local Mode (Stdio)](mcp/local-mode)** | Run local tools securely using standard input/output. Perfect for `git`, `filesystem`, `postgres`. |
| **[Remote Mode (SSE)](mcp/remote-mode)** | Connect to remote MCP servers over HTTP via Server-Sent Events. Ideal for cloud APIs. |
| **[Architecture](architecture)** | Deep dive into how the LangSwarm Host manages MCP Clients and Servers. |

## 🧩 Standard Tools
