- [x] **Fixed**: 2025-07-03 17:30:18,242 - chat_response_agent - ERROR - Agent chat_response_agent: MCP tool filesystem error: local variable 'pkg_dir' referenced before assignment
ERROR:chat_response_agent:Agent chat_response_agent: MCP tool filesystem error: local variable 'pkg_dir' referenced before assignment

**Resolution**: Fixed `pkg_dir` variable reference bug in `langswarm/core/wrappers/middleware.py:_find_workflow_path()` method. The variable is now properly defined in both the importlib.resources code path and the fallback inspection path.

- [x] **Fixed**: 2025-01-07 23:47:51,442 - chat_response_agent - ERROR - Agent chat_response_agent: MCP tool filesystem error: too many values to unpack (expected 4)
ERROR:chat_response_agent:Agent chat_response_agent: MCP tool filesystem error: too many values to unpack (expected 4)

**Resolution**: Fixed tuple unpacking bug in multiple files where `loader.load()` was returning 5 values but code was trying to unpack only 4. Updated all instances to correctly unpack `workflows, agents, brokers, tools, tools_metadata = loader.load()` in:
- `langswarm/core/wrappers/middleware.py` (2 instances)
- `example_mcp_config/test_filesystem_example.py` 
- `tests/integration/test_enhanced_mcp_integration.py` (6 instances)

## 🧪 **TESTING STRATEGY FOR ALL TODO ITEMS**

### **🎯 Core Testing Principles**
Before implementing ANY sub-task, follow this testing approach:

1. **Write Tests First** - Create tests before implementing features
2. **Test Backward Compatibility** - Ensure existing configs still work
3. **Test Graceful Fallbacks** - New features should fall back gracefully
4. **Performance Testing** - No degradation > 20%

### **✅ Safety Checklist for Each Sub-task**
- [ ] **All existing tests pass**: `pytest tests/ -v`
- [ ] **Example configs work**: `python example_mcp_config/test_filesystem_example.py`
- [ ] **Integration tests pass**: `pytest tests/integration/ -v`
- [ ] **New feature has unit tests**: Min 80% code coverage
- [ ] **Backward compatibility verified**: Old configs produce same results
- [ ] **Error handling tested**: Graceful failures, no crashes
- [ ] **Performance benchmarked**: Load time < 5s, response time < 30s

### **🔧 Quick Test Commands**
```bash
# Before starting any sub-task - ensure baseline works
pytest tests/ -v
python example_mcp_config/test_filesystem_example.py

# After implementing sub-task - ensure no regressions
pytest tests/ -v --tb=short
pytest tests/integration/ -v
python scripts/test_all_configs.py  # Test all example configs
```

### **📊 Specific Testing for Major Features**

#### **LLM Abstractions Testing**
```python
# Test native structured responses
def test_structured_response_fallback():
    # Test with OpenAI (should use native)
    agent_new = create_agent(model="gpt-4o", use_native=True)
    # Test with older model (should fallback)
    agent_old = create_agent(model="gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct")
    # Both should work
    assert agent_new.chat("Hello") is not None
    assert agent_old.chat("Hello") is not None

# Test native tool calling
def test_tool_calling_compatibility():
    # Test new native format
    native_tools = [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "read_file"}}]
    # Test old MCP format  
    mcp_format = {"mcp": {"tool": "filesystem", "method": "read_file"}}
    # Both should work
```

#### **Configuration Testing**
```python
# Test single vs multi-file configs
def test_config_equivalence():
    # Load from 8 files
    multi_loader = LangSwarmConfigLoader("example_mcp_config/")
    multi_result = multi_loader.load()
    
    # Load from 1 file
    single_loader = LangSwarmConfigLoader()
    single_result = single_loader.load_single_config("langswarm.yaml")
    
    # Should produce equivalent results
    assert len(multi_result[1]) == len(single_result[1])  # Same number of agents
```

#### **Tool Discovery Testing**
```python
# Test environment-based tool discovery
def test_tool_auto_discovery():
    # Mock GitHub token
    with patch.dict(os.environ, {'GITHUB_TOKEN': 'fake'}):
        tools = auto_discover_tools(["github"])
        assert any(t.id == "github" for t in tools)
    
    # Without token - should handle gracefully
    with patch.dict(os.environ, {}, clear=True):
        tools = auto_discover_tools(["github"])
        # Should not crash
```

### **⚡ Fast Testing Workflow**
For each sub-task implementation:

1. **Pre-implementation**: `pytest tests/test_current_functionality.py -v`
2. **During development**: `pytest tests/test_new_feature.py -v --tb=short`
3. **Post-implementation**: `pytest tests/ -v && python example_mcp_config/test_filesystem_example.py`
4. **Final check**: `python scripts/regression_test.py`

                 - **Implementation Examples**:
            ```python
            # LangSwarm unified session interface
            session = LangSwarmSession(
                user_id="user123",
                session_id="session456", 
                provider="openai"  # Auto-maps to thread_id
            )
            
            # For OpenAI - uses native thread_id
            response = session.chat("Hello!")  # No history needed, handled by OpenAI
            
            # For Claude - client-side history management  
            session_claude = LangSwarmSession(provider="claude")
            response = session_claude.chat("Hello!")  # LangSwarm manages history
            
            # Cross-provider session handoff
            session.switch_provider("claude")  # Maintains conversation context
            ```

            - Provider APIs differ significantly in session management capabilities
            - Need graceful fallbacks when native IDs not available
            - Session storage needs to handle both metadata and conversation history
