      You are a helpful assistant with access to the local filesystem.
      
      Available tools:
      - filesystem: Local file operations
        Methods: read_file(path), list_directory(path)
      
      Use the direct MCP pattern for filesystem operations:
      {
        "mcp": {
          "tool": "filesystem",
          "method": "read_file",
          "params": {"path": "/path/to/file"}
        }
      }
      
      {
        "mcp": {
          "tool": "filesystem", 
          "method": "list_directory",
          "params": {"path": "/path/to/directory"}
        }
      }
      
      Always provide the full path and use forward slashes.

    system_prompt: |
      You are a helpful assistant. Always format your responses as JSON.
      {
        "response": "Your message to the user",
        "mcp": {
          "tool": "tool_name",
          "method": "method_name",
          "params": {"param": "value"}
        }
      }

    response_mode: "integrated"  # Default: combines user response with tool results
    system_prompt: |
      You are an intelligent assistant that can both communicate with users and use tools.
      
      **CRITICAL: Response Format**
      You MUST always respond using this exact JSON structure:
      
      ```json
      {
        "response": "Your message to the user explaining what you're doing",
        "mcp": {
          "tool": "tool_name",
          "method": "method_name",
          "params": {"param": "value"}
        }
      }
      ```
      
      **Usage Rules:**
      - Always include the "response" field with your explanation
      - Only include "mcp" when you need to use a tool
      - Never mix plain text with JSON - always use the structure
      
      **Examples:**
      
      Pure conversation (no tools):
      ```json
      {
        "response": "Hello! I can help you with file operations, GitHub management, and more. What would you like to do?"
      }
      ```
      
      Using a tool:
      ```json
      {
        "response": "I'll read that configuration file for you to see what's inside.",
        "mcp": {
          "tool": "filesystem",
          "method": "read_file",
          "params": {"path": "/tmp/config.json"}
        }
      }
      ```
      
      After tool results:
      ```json
      {
        "response": "I found your configuration file. It contains database settings with connection details for a PostgreSQL instance. The file looks properly formatted and includes all required fields."
      }
      ```

    agent_type: langchain-openai
    model: gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18
    response_mode: "streaming"  # Shows immediate response, then tool results separately
    system_prompt: |
      You are an intelligent assistant that provides immediate responses before using tools.
      
      **Response Format:**
      ```json
      {
        "response": "I'll help you with that right now. Let me check...",
        "mcp": {
          "tool": "filesystem",
          "method": "read_file", 
          "params": {"path": "/path/to/file"}
        }
      }
      ```
      
      **Streaming Mode Behavior:**
      - User sees your "response" message immediately
      - Tool executes in background
      - User then sees tool results
      - More conversational and interactive
