# LangSwarm MVP - Minimum Viable Product

**Orchestrate multiple AI agents to work together - the real power of LangSwarm**

## üéØ MVP Overview

Based on comprehensive analysis of the LangSwarm codebase, this MVP represents the **absolute minimum** functionality needed to demonstrate LangSwarm's core value proposition: **orchestrating multiple AI agents to collaborate on tasks**.

LangSwarm isn't just about creating individual agents - it's about making them **work together intelligently**.

## üöÄ The Real MVP: Agent Orchestration

```python
from langswarm.core.agents import create_openai_agent, register_agent
from langswarm.core.workflows import create_simple_workflow, get_workflow_engine

# Create specialized agents
researcher = create_openai_agent(name="researcher", system_prompt="You research topics thoroughly")
summarizer = create_openai_agent(name="summarizer", system_prompt="You create clear summaries")

# Register agents for orchestration
register_agent(researcher)
register_agent(summarizer)

# Create workflow that orchestrates them
workflow = create_simple_workflow("research_task", "Research and Summarize", ["researcher", "summarizer"])

# Execute orchestrated workflow
engine = get_workflow_engine()
result = await engine.execute_workflow(workflow, {"input": "Benefits of AI in healthcare"})
```

**This is the real MVP** - multiple agents working together through orchestration, not just a single agent.

## üèóÔ∏è MVP Architecture

### 1. **Multi-Agent Creation**
```python
# Create specialized agents with different roles
researcher = create_openai_agent(
    name="researcher",
    system_prompt="You are a research specialist. Gather comprehensive information."
)

summarizer = create_openai_agent(
    name="summarizer", 
    system_prompt="You are a summary specialist. Create clear, concise summaries."
)
```

### 2. **Agent Registration & Orchestration**
```python
# Register agents so workflows can find them
register_agent(researcher)
register_agent(summarizer)

# Create workflow that orchestrates them
workflow = create_simple_workflow(
    workflow_id="research_and_summarize",
    name="Research and Summarize Workflow",
    agent_chain=["researcher", "summarizer"]  # researcher ‚Üí summarizer
)
```

### 3. **Workflow Execution**
```python
# Execute the orchestrated workflow
engine = get_workflow_engine()
result = await engine.execute_workflow(
    workflow=workflow,
    input_data={"input": "What are the benefits of AI in healthcare?"}
)

print(f"Final Result: {result.output}")
# The researcher gathered info, then the summarizer created a summary
```

## üèÅ Conclusion

This MVP represents the **essence of LangSwarm**: making powerful multi-agent orchestration accessible to everyone. By reducing the barrier to entry to just 10 lines of code, we enable:

1. **Rapid orchestration prototyping** - Test multi-agent concepts immediately
2. **Learning collaboration patterns** - Understand how agents work together
3. **Production-ready foundations** - Build on solid, scalable orchestration architecture
4. **Progressive enhancement** - Add more agents, tools, and complex workflows

The MVP proves that **orchestration complexity can be made simple**. LangSwarm can be both the easiest way to get started with multi-agent systems AND the most powerful framework for enterprise orchestration.

**Start with 2 agents collaborating. Scale to enterprise orchestration. That's the LangSwarm promise.**
