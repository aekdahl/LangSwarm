# Updated LangSwarm Installation Tiers

## üéØ **Revised Installation Strategy**

Based on user feedback, we've updated the installation tiers to be more practical:

### üèÉ **Minimal Installation: `pip install langswarm`**
**What You Get (9 dependencies):**
- Complete LangSwarm framework
- **OpenAI provider included** (GPT-4o, GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo)
- SQLite memory backend
- Full function calling and tool integration
- Cost tracking and streaming responses

**Perfect For:**
- Getting started immediately with AI capabilities
- Prototyping and development
- Single-provider applications
- Learning LangSwarm with real AI functionality

### üöÄ **Additional Providers: `pip install langswarm[providers]`**
**What This Adds:**
- Anthropic (Claude models)
- Google (Gemini models)  
- Cohere (Command models)
- Mistral (Mistral models)

**Perfect For:**
- Production systems needing redundancy
- Cost optimization across providers
- Different models for different tasks

### üéØ **Essential Setup: `pip install langswarm[essential]`**
**What's Included:**
```python
essential = [
    "anthropic", "google-generativeai", "cohere", "mistralai",  # All AI providers
    "redis", "aioredis",                                        # Scalable memory
    "fastapi", "uvicorn"                                        # Web framework
]
```

**Perfect For:**
- Full development environment
- Production applications with all provider options
- Web APIs and webhook services

### üè≠ **Production Setup: `pip install langswarm[production]`**
**What's Included:**
```python
production = [
    "anthropic",                    # Key backup provider to OpenAI
    "redis", "aioredis",           # Production memory backend
    "fastapi", "uvicorn",          # Web framework
    "google-cloud-bigquery"        # Analytics storage
]
```

**Perfect For:**
- Production deployments
- Enterprise applications
- Analytics and compliance requirements

## üìä **Comparison Matrix**

| Tier | Dependencies | AI Providers | Memory | Web | Use Case |
|------|--------------|--------------|--------|-----|----------|
| **Minimal** | 9 | OpenAI | SQLite | None | Getting Started |
| **+Providers** | 13 | All 5 | SQLite | None | Multi-provider |
| **Essential** | 17 | All 5 | SQLite + Redis | FastAPI | Full Development |
| **Production** | 15 | OpenAI + Anthropic | Redis + BigQuery | FastAPI | Enterprise |
| **All** | 50+ | All | All | All | Everything |

## üéâ **Key Benefits of This Approach**

### ‚úÖ **Immediate Utility**
- Even minimal installation provides full AI capabilities
- No need for additional setup to start building agents
- OpenAI is the most commonly used provider

### ‚úÖ **Progressive Enhancement**
- Start with OpenAI, add other providers as needed
- Scale from simple to complex deployments
- Pay only for what you use

### ‚úÖ **Practical Defaults**
- Most users want AI capabilities immediately
- OpenAI has the best documentation and ecosystem
- SQLite works for development and small production

### ‚úÖ **Clear Upgrade Paths**
```bash
# Start simple
pip install langswarm

# Add provider redundancy  
pip install langswarm[providers]

# Scale to production
pip install langswarm[production]

# Add specific features
pip install langswarm[platforms]  # Discord, Slack, etc.
```

## üîÑ **Migration from Previous Approach**

**Old Approach:**
- Minimal = Framework only (no AI)
- Required separate OpenAI installation
- Users needed to understand providers before getting started

**New Approach:**
- Minimal = Framework + OpenAI (immediate AI capabilities)
- Most practical default for new users
- Clear path to add more providers

## üí° **Usage Examples**

### **Day 1: Get Started**
```bash
pip install langswarm
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
```

```python
from langswarm import create_openai_agent

agent = create_openai_agent(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")
response = await agent.chat("Hello!")
```

### **Week 1: Add Provider Redundancy**
```bash
pip install langswarm[providers]
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"
```

### **Month 1: Scale to Production**
```bash
pip install langswarm[production]
# Now have Redis, BigQuery, and Anthropic backup
```

This approach gives users immediate value while maintaining the flexibility to scale up as needed.
