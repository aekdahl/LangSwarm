# LangSwarm V2 References Removal Summary

**Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

## Summary

All references to "V2" have been removed from the LangSwarm codebase since all legacy V1 code has been archived and the entire codebase is now the current version.

## Changes Made

### 1. Documentation Files Updated ✅

- **`docs/README.md`** - Removed "V2" from title and all references
  - Changed "LangSwarm V2 Documentation" → "LangSwarm Documentation"
  - Updated welcome message to remove V2
  - Changed "Features Preserved in V2" → "Core Features"
  - Updated migration references to indicate archived status

- **`docs/getting-started/quickstart/README.md`** - Updated title
  - Changed "LangSwarm V2 Quickstart" → "LangSwarm Quickstart"

- **`FIXME.md`** - Updated analysis report
  - Removed references to "V2 rewrite"
  - Changed "V1 and V2 code" → "current and legacy code"
  - Updated recommendations to mention "legacy code" instead of "V1"

### 2. Example Files Updated ✅

- **`example_config.yaml`**
  - Changed "LangSwarm V2 - Working Configuration Example" → "LangSwarm - Working Configuration Example"
  - Updated name field from "LangSwarm V2 Example" → "LangSwarm Example"

- **`example_working.py`**
  - Removed all "V2" references in comments and print statements
  - Updated title and success messages

### 3. Code Files Updated ✅

- **`langswarm/core/middleware/__init__.py`**
  - Changed "LangSwarm V2 Middleware System" → "LangSwarm Middleware System"
  - Updated import from `pipeline_v2` → `unified_pipeline`
  - Updated comment "Pipeline (Unified V2 System)" → "Pipeline (Unified System)"

- **Renamed Files**:
  - `langswarm/core/middleware/pipeline_v2.py` → `unified_pipeline.py`
  - Updated docstring to remove V2 reference

### 4. Configuration Files Updated ✅

- **Renamed Test Configs**:
  - `langswarm/test_configs/v2_debug_config.yaml` → `debug_config.yaml`
  - `langswarm/test_configs/bigquery_v2_test.yaml` → `bigquery_test.yaml`

### 5. Migration Folders Preserved

- **`docs/migration/v1-to-v2/`** - Left as-is for historical reference
  - These contain migration guides that may still be useful
  - Consider moving to `archived/` if no longer needed

## Remaining Considerations

1. **Version Number**: The "2.0.0" in `langswarm/__init__.py` was just a working label during development. The actual package version (0.0.54.dev45) correctly reflects the release version and should remain unchanged.

2. **Migration Docs**: The `docs/migration/v1-to-v2/` folder still exists. These could be:
   - Moved to `archived/` folder
   - Renamed to `legacy-migration/`
   - Left as-is if still useful for users migrating from old versions

3. **Git Tags**: Git tags with "v2" in them (e.g., `v0.0.52.dev2`) are historical and cannot/should not be changed.

## Impact

- **Clarity**: No more confusion about V1 vs V2 - it's just LangSwarm
- **Simplicity**: Cleaner documentation and examples
- **Professional**: Consistent naming throughout the codebase
- **Future-proof**: Ready for continued development without version confusion

## Next Steps

1. Consider updating the version number in `langswarm/__init__.py`
2. Decide on handling of migration documentation
3. Update any external documentation or websites
4. Ensure all imports of renamed files are updated throughout the codebase
